The Kiso core is simple. There are Classes and Interfaces. From that everything else is built. I 
started the project as an exploration of how javascript's prototypical inheritance could be 
integrated with the concept of interfaces. I further added functionality to enforce those interfaces 
during the class declaration along with class constants and object variable default values. 

There is some fun stuff (in other words fun for me, for example the geom classes) built into Kiso. 
But, I'm hoping to add more functional things to Kiso in the next few months. My hope is to push 
Kiso forward towards becoming a full blown framework. For example, documentation is badly needed. 
It's been started but needs to be improved. I'll also, as I'm able, be adding DOM manipulation and 
event handling. 

In the long term (read: in my dreams were I don't have to work) I'd really like to rewrite the unit 
tests to use a native Kiso unit testing. I'd also want to expand the DOM and event objects to work 
with a whole suite of widgets (the cookie adapter just looks so lonely there in the ui section). 

Take a look around and if you like the project let me know; if you love the project, definitely let 
me know; and if you don't like the project, let me know nicely. Thanks for stopping by.
