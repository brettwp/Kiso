Kiso has been abandoned.

This code from 2010 was my attempt at easing `Class` and `Interface` creation in Javascript.
I was also reading about some polygon approximation algorithms so decided to throw that in
there too.  But, it has since lost it's usefulness and has been abandoned.  It lives here
now as an example of how I wrote code back then and just in case I or anyone should need it
for any reason.
